# The-Iris-Dataset
In this project I have tried to build two classifiers of the iris data set using One-vs-All Classification Algorithm and Neural Networks.

In case of One-vs-All Classification Algorithm, I was able to achieve a maximum accuracy of 96.67% on the training set itself in spite of increasing the number of iterations. On the other hand, the neural network was able to achieve a maximum efficiency of 98.67% on the training set.
